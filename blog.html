                    <h2>Pre-Writing Tips</h2>
                    <p>Your content’s foundation should be laid before you start writing, and here are three key points
                        to keep in mind.</p>
                        <h2>Tip #1: Define Your Purpose</h2>
                        <p>The single most important thing for any writer of copy is to understand its purpose. Knowing your end goal from the outset helps you craft the perfect piece of content and an ideal call-to-action statement (I’ll talk more about CTAs in Writing Tips). 

                            The objective of the copy supports the goals of the business. So, find your answers to the questions about it:
                            
                            Is the website intended to sell a product or a service?
                            Is it focused on building traffic with the intention of increasing advertising revenue or sponsorships?
                            Is it aimed at attracting new clients and generating leads?
                            Is the main objective to attract subscribers or build a community?</p>
                            <h2>Tip #2: Understand Your Target Audience </h2>
                            <p>Let's say selling is your primary goal. You can determine the best methods of selling only by knowing your audience. The more you know about your prospects, the better you can convert them into paying customers. 

                                To write copy that hooks your potential customers, you need to get into their mindset:
                                
                                Who are the people coming to your site? 
                                
                                What kinds of problems do they want to solve?
                                
                                What search terms would they type into a search bar?
                                
                                If you can learn to write in the ways in which your visitors speak or search, you can start building up a relationship of trust. And if you answer their specific question, they may become your loyal audience and clients. 
                                
                                </p>
                                <h2>Tip #3: Know Your Competitors</h2>
                                <p>It's also a good move to do some research on the websites of your competitors.

                                    It’s likely that visitors to your website will also be considering the competition, so you need to make a strategic decision about whether to offer similar content or branch out and offer something different. Research can be an excellent way to spot trends among competitors and get ahead of the game. 
                                    
                                    The easiest way to do this is simply to search your main product, service, or topic in Google, discover which sites are ranking, and investigate what they are doing:
                                    
                                    What is the primary service they offer?
                                    
                                    What type of content do they use on their main pages — success stories, videos, statistics?
                                    
                                    What audience do they target? </p>
